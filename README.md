# Telegram-bot Dossier Creator 
Hi üëã 

This is my unfinished bot.

This bot is created to save time for recruiters and interviewers with giving brief information about interviewee.

How it works?
Bot is based on python language with usage of tele-bot library.

Dossier is creating from information based on parsing of profile pages on GITHub and LinkedIn and after the job with parsing is done, bot can send you file.

In this project I will parse two pages in two different ways: for Git I will use their own API and for LinkedIn I will parse it using linkedin_api library in Python and also account for passing permissions.

What information is taken from profiles?

From LinkedIn bot will take personal information such as: full name, education, location, and skills.

From GITHub it will parse: activity and make graphics based on it.

All photos will be changed after final release!

I made this bot using Python.
